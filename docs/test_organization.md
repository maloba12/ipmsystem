# Test Organization and Production Considerations

## Test File Organization

### Frontend Tests
- Located in `tests/frontend/`
- Contains UI and frontend functionality tests
- Example: `test.js` - Frontend API integration tests

### Backend Tests
- Located in `tests/backend/`
- Contains server-side functionality tests
- Examples:
  - `test.php` - Basic database connection test
  - `test_passwords.php` - Password hashing and validation tests
  - `test_roles.php` - Role-based access control tests

### Database Tests
- Located in `tests/database/`
- Contains database schema and data integrity tests
- Examples:
  - `test_db.php` - Database connection and configuration tests
  - `test_schema.php` - Database schema validation tests

### API Tests
- Located in `tests/api/`
- Contains API endpoint tests
- To be implemented in future versions

## Production Considerations

### Test Files
- All test files are excluded from production via `.gitignore`
- Tests should be run in development environment only
- Test files should not be deployed to production servers

### Database
- Use separate test database for testing
- Never run tests against production database
- Clean up test data after tests

### Security
- Never include sensitive data in test files
- Use mock data for testing
- Ensure test credentials are different from production

### Environment
- Run tests in a dedicated test environment
- Use environment variables to distinguish between test and production
- Never mix test and production configurations
